# Homeroom - An NEA Programming Project.  
A MIS (Management Information System) for schools. Handles register, safety and administrative systems for schools. Ensuring kids stay safe. This is a project for the OCR Computer Science NEA. In order to maintain the integrity of the NEA, no Pull Requests will be reviewed or accepted until the submission of the project. Suggestions and comments are welcome through the use of issue tickets, but the chances of them being reviewed are low until the final product has been launched.

##### Devlog

##### Task Management
[A Trello Board is being used to track tasks and issues. Anything task that needs to be completed that is related to 'Homeroom' will be held here](https://trello.com/b/dveKhRua).


##### Testing
[A markdown file is also being used to work with any testing of any features that may need to be done.](https://github.com/longbow122/Homeroom/blob/main/TESTING.md)

*I believe you're able to link GitHub issues to Trello cards through the use of a power-up or some sort of integration. If someone knows of any ways through which this can be done, please let me know! (Will have to look into it when I get the time)*
